### R Markdown exercise. Sampling from log-normal distribution

***1.*** Sample 100 values from log-normal distribution with mean 1 and variance 0.25.

```{r sample}
set.seed(560)# for reproducibility
x <- rlnorm(100, 1, .25) #sample size, mean, variance
```

***2.*** Sample mean:

```{r mean}
mean(x)
```

***3.*** Sample variance:

```{r variance}
var(x)
```

### Histogram

***1.*** Histogram of the distribution:

```{r histogram, }
hist(x)
```

***2.*** Histogram of the distribution on the log scale:

```{r logHistogram, }
h = hist(x, plot=F)
h$counts = log10(h$counts)
plot(h, ylab='log10(Frequency)')
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
